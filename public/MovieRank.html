<h1>Top 5 best movies </h1>
<h2>(according to me)</h2>
<hr>
<h3>300</h3>
<p>Pure Spartan adrenaline and testosterone, a must watch for any man that wants to grow a beard</p>
<h3>Bronson</h3>
<p>The OG schizo lifter, great motivation if you're feeling down or in a rut</p>
<h3>2001: A Space Odyssey</h3>
<p>An awesome movie, that does not allow you to doze off to your phone</p>
<h3>Interestellar</h3>
<p>A modern 2001, different in many ways but equally good</p>
<h3>Taxi Driver</h3>
<p>Not for everyone</p>
